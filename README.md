# Akash Veerappan

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository. I am Akash, and I am a CS major at Georgia Tech. I have been coding since eighth grade and have been an avid developer ever since. My goal has always been to help people with technology and that is precisely what I have been doing by creating several different prototypical projects (which you can see in my repositories) and by successfully releasing an Android application to the Google Play Store! 

You can check the app out [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=shush.android.app&hl=en_US)!
