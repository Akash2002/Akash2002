# Akash Veerappan

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository. I am Akash, and I am a CS major at Georgia Tech. I have been coding since eighth grade and have been an avid developer ever since. My goal has always been to help people with technology and that is precisely what I have been doing by creating several different prototypical projects and by successfully releasing an Android application to the Google Play Store.
