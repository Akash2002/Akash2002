# Akash Veerappan

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository. I am Akash, and I am a CS major at Georgia Tech. I have been building software since eighth grade and have been an avid developer ever since. My goal has always been to help people with technology and that is precisely what I have been doing by creating several different prototypical projects (which you can see in my repositories).

### Most Recent Project
------------
Check out [studygenerator.com](https://www.studygenerator.com), your #1 product to automatically generate questions, studyguides, and flashcards to master any content in no time! If you want to know more about how [Max](https://github.com/MaxRatmeyer) and I built the product, click [here](https://github.com/MLHUnihack2020)!

### Most Recent Experience
------------
I interned at Meta (Summer 2022) for the WhatsApp Android team, where I developed the feature that lets users undo an accidental delete for me, so that they can later delete it for everyone given. Learn more about it on my LinkedIn below.
